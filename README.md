## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to construct, using the Java programming language, a cross-assembler that processes Cm Assembly Language, all the while applying agile processes learned in the course. The cross-assembler reads an assembly language source file to generate an in-memory intermediate representation (IR), which is then traversed, outputting an executable file. The assembly language is a source file that consists of low-level programming, a series of binary instructions that has one to one correspondence with machine code, and is represented by the following symbol names: labels, mnemonics and operands. The assembly language source files are provided to the team.
